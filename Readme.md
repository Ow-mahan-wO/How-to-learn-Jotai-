# How to learn Jotai ?!

![Jotai Logo](./images/logo.jpg "Jotai").

## First of all, I want to give a basic explanation about stateManagement.

## In our state managers, we have three types of architecture: flux, proxy, and atomic, each of which has a different structure and is not very similar. In flux architecture we have redux and zustand for example and in proxy architecture we have Mobx for example and in Atomic architecture we have Jotai or Recoil for example

# What is Jotai ?
## Jotai is a relatively new state management library for React which works with (atom). It's simple, but make no mistakes, it's a robust library.
## Jotai is based on the new Recoil pattern and library by Facebook. 

# Why we should learn Jotai ?!
## Redux is often used in large-scale projects due to its ability to maintain states at a large scale. If we want to use state managers in a small project, Redux doesn't seem reasonable and we have to use the context API. However, Jotai comes to our aid and makes managing states in the program easy with its atomic structure and is very fast and convenient. This is one reason to learn Jotai, and another reason may be that we have the opportunity to get acquainted with other architectures and state managers.

# How to learn Jotai ?
## We learn step by step with the official jotai document and its practice. Let's go to start.
